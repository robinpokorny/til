### :bulb: TIL

A collection of my small everyday **Today I Learned** blibs

## [Read here](../../discussions/categories/til)

> Some things are too small to warrant a [blog](https://robinpokorny.com/blog/) post, yet too valuable to be just a tweet.
> 
> That is why I created this collection.
> It is very much for the future me.
> I hope you might find something new, too!

### About this repo
This repo uses GitHub Discussions to share the TILs. While only I can add new posts, everybody can comment on them. Did you know you can learn more than one thing in a day? :sweat_smile:
